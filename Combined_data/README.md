To create the working data file, create a .xlsx file called KOMF01_combined in the folder and copy ...part_1, ...part_2 and ...part_3 into it in that order

This means that only ONE file is to be created with the name KOMF01_combined.xlsx
The combined file should only include ONE header, and should have 254087 lines (last line)

The reason for this is large amount on data and upload limitations on GitHub
